# Webhooks

Both App and User access tokens can access this at the moment.

## Headers

| Header | Type | Short Description |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Kick-Event-Message-Id | ULID | Unique message id, idempotent key. |
| Kick-Event-Signature | Base64 Encode String | Signature to verify the sender |
| Kick-Event-Message-Timestamp | RFC3339 Date-time | Timestamp of when the message was sent |
| Kick-Event-Type | string | Eg. channel:write |
| Kick-Event-Version | string | Eg. 1 |

## Webhook Sender Validation

_Please Note! This currently isn't working as intended and is in the process of being fixed._

Kick-Event-Message-Signature header is used to validate if a request has come from the Kick servers. This is to prevent anyone that found an apps webhook endpoint from sending fake events.

### Kick Public Key

This is the Kick public key. Any request that is sent from our servers will be have a signature signed by our Private Key, which can be decrypted using this Public Key.

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

### Signature Creation

The signature is created through the concatenation of the following values into a single string:

* Kick-Event-Message-Id
* Kick-Event-Message-Timestamp
* The raw body of the request

Once concatenated, the body will be signed with the Kick Private Key.

### Examples

Here are some examples of verifying the signature in different languages.

#### Golang

```go
func Verify(publicKey *rsa.PublicKey, body []byte, signature []byte) error {
   decoded := make([]byte, base64.StdEncoding.DecodedLen(len(signature)))

   n, err := base64.StdEncoding.Decode(decoded, signature)
   if err != nil {
       return err
   }


   signature = decoded[:n]
   hashed := sha256.Sum256(body)


   return rsa.VerifyPKCS1v15(publicKey, crypto.SHA256, hashed[:], signature)
}

```

## Retrying Sending of Events

Kick will attempt to send a webhook 3 times over a period of time until a 200 response is made by the server.

## Disabling of webhooks

After a certain thresholds of errors received from an apps webhook endpoint, Kick may automatically unsubscribe the app from receiving webhooks.

The app would then need to resubscribe to webhooks.
